#+TITLE: Padding for inline elements
* Question
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: question
  :END:

I am reading a book about CSS basics. It is claimed in the book that an
inline element has complete padding properties but no
*margin-top/bottom* properties, only *margin-left/right* properties.

My first question is, where can I find this as an official statement? I
found [[http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visudet.html#q15][here]] that if
*margin-top/bottom* is set to =auto= then it is set to =0=. But isn't
that different from saying *margin-top/bottom* does not apply to
inline-elements?

My second question is, does an inline element really got complete
padding properties? I tried the following example:

[[file:./static/Padding for inline elements/886.jpeg]]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

    <head> </head>

    <body>
      <div style="margin: 20px; border: solid 20px;background: red;">
        <p style="margin:0">
          test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test
          <strong style="padding:20px;background-color:yellow">hello</strong> test test test test
        </p>
      </div>
    </body>

#+END_QUOTE

You won't, because it isn't quite true. In the [[https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/box.html#propdef-margin-top][box model]]
it says that for margin-top and margin-bottom:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  These properties have no effect on non-replaced inline elements.
#+END_QUOTE

But "no effect" does not mean that the properties don't exist.
Specifically, they do exist for the purposes of inheritance. Consider
this example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    p { border:1px solid red }
    i { vertical-align:top; }
    span { margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  }
    b { display:inline-block; }
    .two { margin:inherit;  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <p><i>Hello</i> <span>World <b class="one">my good friend</b></span></p>
    <p><i>Hello</i> <span>World <b class="two">my good friend</b></span></p>

  I found here that if margin-top/bottom is set to 'auto' then it is set
  to '0'. But isn't that different from saying 'margin-top/botton does
  not apply to inline-elements'?

In 8.1 Box Model Spec
([[http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/box.html#propdef-margin]]) "The margin
edge surrounds the box margin. If the margin has 0 width(height), the
margin edge is the same as the border edge."

In the page you linked 10.6.1 "The 'height' property doesn't apply, but
the height of the box is given by the 'line-height' property." So since
height doesn't apply, then the margin-edge is the same as the border
edge.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  My second question is, does an inline element really got complete
  padding properties? I tried the following example:
#+END_QUOTE

Same reason as above. "the height of the box is given by the
'line-height' property". The height of that strong element is set by the
=line-height= as it has no height to reference as a block or
inline-block element would. I'm pretty sure if you gave it inline-block
properties it would as a block has height in the model.

  but for some reason it has no effect on the surrounding text
#+END_QUOTE

Try substituting =margin= for =padding= at =strong= element, adding
=display:inline-block= to =strong= style

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div style="margin: 20px;
              border: solid 20px;
              background: red;">
        <p style='margin:0'>test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test
          <strong style="margin:20px;background-color:yellow;display:inline-block;">hello</strong>
          test test test test</p>
      </div>
    </body>
    </html>
