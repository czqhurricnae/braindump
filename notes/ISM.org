The IOSA Standards Manual (ISM) is published in order to provide the IOSA standards, recommended
practices ([[id:57A30C28-71FA-4CE1-8EA4-30B25556AEFF][ISARPs]]), associated guidance material and other supporting information necessary for an operator
to successfully prepare for an audit.

The ISM is the sole source of assessment criteria to be used by auditors when conducting an audit against
the ISARPs.

The ISM may also be used as a guide for any operator desiring to structure its operational management and
control systems in conformity with the latest industry operational practices.
